>>> the test_list.txt file should have exactly one enter below the last value
>>> make sure the RPLAN_small is in the heat\data
>>> make sure you are in the heat folder

>>> run the infer script as follows:
python infer.py --checkpoint_path ./checkpoints/ckpts_heat_s3d_256/checkpoint.pth  --dataset RPLAN_small --image_size 256 --viz_base ./results/viz_heat_RPLAN_small_256 --save_base ./results/npy_heat_RPLAN_small_256

>>> visualize Results (predicted labels)
